iproute2 cheatsheet
===================

The ip command from Linux iproute2 package replaced the old ifconfig, vconfig etc. commands,
however, its man pages don't really explain how to use it, and there was no definitive guide that
would cover all or at least most of its functions.

This oversized cheatsheet aims to become such a guide. To help people start using it, it doesn't
list features of iproute2, but rather lists common network administration tasks and explains how to
perform them with iproute2.
